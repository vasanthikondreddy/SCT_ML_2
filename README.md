#Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project groups retail store customers based on their purchasing behavior using unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering).
## 📌 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Customer ID
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)

## 🔍 Objective
Segment customers into different groups to help the business understand:
- High-spending customers
- Budget-conscious groups
- Targetable age-income segments

##  Steps Performed
1. Load and clean data
2. Encode Gender
3. Use Elbow method to choose optimal clusters
4. Train KMeans
5. Visualize clusters

##  Output

The Elbow method suggests 5 clusters, and a color-coded scatter plot shows the segmented customer groups.

## 🚀 How to Run
- Clone the repo
- Run `mall_customer.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
